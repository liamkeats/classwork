	 * CHAPTER 6
	 * Math is done before relationals, then logical operators. Theoretically. 
	 * In actual execution, that may not be the order things go, short circuit prevents anything after an and symbol until anything after the and symbol has been evaluated to a boolean.
	 * You can put troublesome statements after an and statement to prevent this.
	 * 
	 * DE MORGANS LAW
	 * 
	 * NESTED if-else
	 * if-else-if
	 * don't put a semi colon at the end of an if statement.
	 * the switch statement.
	 * takes an expressian and checks the case values agains the statement.
	 * it will check if num is equal to whatever, but you need a break.
	 * you can't use cmd == "Help"
	 * the colon is is to check if the the case is after the case num
	 * 
	 * enum data types
	 * Used when an objects attribute or state can have only one of a small set of values, for example.
	 * 
	 * private enum speed{LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH};
	 * ...
	 * Speed currentSpeed = Speed.LOW
	 * this is an object of the Speed class,
	 * ....
	 * if (currentSpeed -- Speed.LOW) ...
	 * THey can be used in a switch
	 * Speed is a class which has LOW MEDIUM AND HIGH objects.
	 * 
	 * Do craps game project.
	 * 
	 * Chapter 7
	 * 
	 * Understand general properties of algorithms
	 * Get familiar with pseudocode and flowcharts
	 * Learn about iterations
	 * Understand the semantics and learn the Java syntax for while, for, and do-while loops
	 * Long division, and other stuff
	 * 
	 * Pseudocode to caluclate series.
	 * 
	 * Input: n
	 * Sum <- 0
	 * k <- 1
	 * 
	 *

	 * 
	 * Flowchart, inputs/outputs
	 * processing step
	 * decision
	 * n

	 * 
	 * properties of algorithms
	 * 
	 * iteration
	 * while (confition)
	 * {
	 * 
	 * 
	 * while p < x 
	 * 
	 * if you don't have something that changes the value of p this loop will never end. You need to initialize test and then change.
	 * 
	 * the while loop continued
	 * 
	 * sometimes change is implicit.
	 * 
	 * He is using a scanner class that waits for an input and as soon as he gets the input it fails.
	 * 
	 * do-while loop
	 * 
	 * a do loop runs before checking
	 * 
	 * a while checks and then runs
	 * 
	 * it is convenient when the variables ...
	 * 
	 * difference between a break and a loop
	 * 
	 * break kicks you out of a loop
	 * 
	 *return kicks you out of the area
	 *
	 *a loop in a loop is nested
	 * 
	 * braces are optional when the body of the loops is one statement
	 * 
	 * triangular nested loops
	 * when the inne loops mentions the outer loops inner layer,
	 * it code traces the value of the iterator

	 * LAP PERFECT NUMBERS
